# 0001. Serve stdio, streamable HTTP and SSE from one command line

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Deciders:** maintainer

## Context

Since 0.0.1 the server has run on stdio only: a client spawns the
process, nothing listens. That still fits a developer's laptop. It does
not fit a shared deployment, a gateway that fans one server out to many
agents, or an auditor such as scout that speaks HTTP. The MCP
specification now has two current revisions on the HTTP binding,
`2025-11-25` (an `initialize` handshake and a session header) and
`2026-07-28` (stateless, per-request `_meta`, `server/discover`), and
clients on either must be served. The older HTTP+SSE transport
(`2024-11-05`) is still what some hosts expect.

## Options considered

1. Stay on stdio and leave remote use to a wrapper process.
2. Add HTTP behind a bespoke module per server, each with its own flags.
3. One shared module, copied verbatim into every server of the suite,
   that maps the same three flags onto the SDK's transports.

## Decision

Option 3. `structured-address-fix-mcp` runs stdio;
`structured-address-fix-mcp --transport streamable-http` listens on
`--host`/`--port` at `/mcp` and speaks both current protocol revisions
on that one endpoint, streaming responses as server-sent events and
offering the server-to-client stream on `GET`;
`structured-address-fix-mcp --transport sse` serves the older HTTP+SSE
transport at `/sse` and `/messages/`. The module binds loopback unless
told otherwise and adds no authentication of its own: a routable
deployment sits behind a gateway the operator trusts. The OAuth 2.1
resource-server layer on the [roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md) is additional
flags on the same command line, not a second entry point.

## Consequences

`main()` delegates to `_cli.serve`, which with `_transports.run` is the
same pair of files in every server, so the suite is started, documented
and tested the same way. Each server is verified over streamable HTTP
with scout in both protocol eras and over SSE with the SDK client before
release; the conformance workflow lists tools over every transport. The
stdio `main()` test stays as it was.
