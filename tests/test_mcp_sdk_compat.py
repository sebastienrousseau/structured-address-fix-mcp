"""Regression tests for the ``mcp`` SDK compatibility layer.

``mcp`` 2.0 removed ``mcp.server.fastmcp`` and renamed ``FastMCP`` to
``MCPServer``, which broke every import site in this package. These tests
pin the behaviour that has to hold on *whichever* major is installed, so
the next SDK move fails here rather than at runtime in a client.

The suite runs against one installed major at a time; CI's pinned
requirements resolve mcp 2.x, and the 1.x branch is exercised by
installing the floor of the declared range.
