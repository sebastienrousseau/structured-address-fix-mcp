"""The README's tool list must match what the server actually registers.

A tool that is registered but undocumented is invisible: nobody calls it,
nobody reviews it, and it drifts. That is not hypothetical here --
four tools -- `normalize_country_code`, `split_street_and_building`,
`validate_postal_policy` and `parse_address_libpostal` -- were all
registered and absent from the README, and the stated tool count said
nine while thirteen were registered.

Documentation drift is silent by nature: nothing fails, the tests pass,
and the only symptom is a feature nobody knows exists. This makes it
fail.
